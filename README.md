# Neural-Style-Transfer

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** using both **Classical (VGG-based)** and **Fast (TF Hub pre-trained)** methods. It allows you to blend the content of one image with the style of another — turning your photos into artwork!

## 🧪 Methodology

### 🎯 Goal
Blend two images — a **content image** and a **style image** — to generate a new image that maintains the content of the first and the artistic style of the second.

### 1. **Classical Style Transfer (VGG19-based)**
- Uses pre-trained **VGG19** model
- Optimizes total loss = content loss + style loss + total variation loss
- Highly tunable with weights and iteration count
- Slower but customizable and research-oriented

### 2. **Fast Style Transfer (TF Hub Model)**
- Uses pre-trained feed-forward model from **TensorFlow Hub**
- Real-time stylization
- Faster, best for live demos & web apps
- Limited control over fine-tuning
